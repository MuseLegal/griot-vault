## üß† What We‚Äôre Building

Griot Vault is a structured archive of African history, proverbs, movements, and cultural insights built in Markdown format and visualized in Obsidian. Every note becomes part of an interlinked knowledge system.

## üìù Style Guide for Obsidian Formatting

- Use `[[Linked Entry Title]]` for internal links between notes.
  - ‚úÖ Example: `[[University of Michigan Black Action Movements (BAM)]]`
- Keep all filenames in lowercase, using underscores:  
  - ‚úÖ `university_of_michigan_black_action_movements.md`
- Begin each file with the YAML block (`---`) and complete all fields you can.
- Use concise, clear headings:
  - `## Summary`, `## Context`, `## Significance`, `## Sources`, etc.

---

## üõë Respect + Accuracy

- Verify sources when writing historical or cultural information.
- For oral traditions, include as much context as possible (who, when, where).
- Do not submit copyrighted or commercial content.

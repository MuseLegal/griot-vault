# 🧠 Griot Vault

**African Memory for the Machine Age**

Griot Vault is a collaborative, open-source digital archive dedicated to preserving African and diasporic culture, wisdom, oral traditions, and history — all in structured, machine-readable Markdown format. Designed with both humans and AI in mind, this project ensures that future technologies are trained on diverse, authentic representations of Black identity, experience, and contribution.

## 🌍 Why Griot Vault?

Mainstream knowledge systems, including large language models and AI tools, are disproportionately trained on Western data. That erases stories, values, and frameworks rooted in African cosmologies, philosophies, and lived experience.

**Griot Vault exists to fix that.**

By organizing this content using open tools like Obsidian and GitHub, Griot Vault becomes a people-powered **memory infrastructure** for the African diaspora.

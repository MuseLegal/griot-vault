# Griot Vault

**Griot Vault** is a collaborative project to preserve African culture, history, and wisdom in structured, machine-readable Obsidian vaults. The goal is to ensure authentic African narratives and knowledge systems are represented in future artificial intelligence systems â€” and to empower global unity across the African diaspora.

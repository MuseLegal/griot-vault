## Summary
The Black Action Movements (BAM I, II, and III) were a series of coordinated Black student-led protests at the University of Michigan demanding racial equity, increased Black enrollment, and institutional support for Black students, faculty, and programs.

## Context
BAM I erupted in 1970 following unmet demands from the Black Student Union. Students organized class walkouts, rallies, and community engagement. At its peak, nearly 90% of Black students participated, shutting down university operations.

BAM II (1975) and BAM III (1987) followed as the university repeatedly failed to meet promises made after the first movement, especially around Black faculty hiring and funding for [[Black Studies Programs]].

## Significance
BAM influenced national conversations about diversity and equity in higher education. It also institutionalized support structures like [[Trotter Multicultural Center]] and accelerated the growth of African American studies departments.

BAM is a local embodiment of larger struggles tied to the [[Civil Rights Movement]], but it also serves as a model for sustained student activism and holding institutions accountable over decades.

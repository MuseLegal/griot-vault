## Summary
The Black Action Movements (BAM) were a series of student-led protests and coalitional organizing efforts at the University of Michigan aimed at increasing the representation, support, and visibility of Black students and faculty. There were three major BAM efforts: BAM I (1970), BAM II (1975), and BAM III (1987). These movements marked significant moments in the history of racial justice advocacy in higher education and shaped university policy for decades.

## Context
BAM emerged during a period of heightened racial consciousness and activism following the broader Civil Rights and Black Power movements in the United States. In the late 1960s, Black students at the University of Michigan formed the Black Student Union (BSU) and began demanding greater institutional accountability in addressing racial inequities on campus. Among their demands were increased Black student enrollment, financial aid, faculty hiring, and the establishment of an autonomous Department of Afroamerican and African Studies.

### BAM I (1970)
Triggered by the university's failure to meet enrollment goals and its weak institutional response to racism, BAM I was a campus-wide strike organized by the BSU and supported by many white allies, including faculty and graduate students. The central demand was for Black student enrollment to reach 10% by the 1973–74 academic year. BAM I resulted in the cancellation of classes for nearly two weeks and brought widespread attention to racial disparities in higher education.

### BAM II (1975)
BAM II was organized in response to the administration's failure to follow through on commitments made during BAM I. The movement focused on the erosion of previous gains and the lack of progress in faculty hiring, support for Black programs, and sustained funding. Though not as disruptive as BAM I, it reflected the persistence of racial inequity and deepened the push for institutional change.

### BAM III (1987)
BAM III occurred in a national context of anti-affirmative action backlash and rising racial tensions on campuses across the United States. The movement reignited calls for increased Black faculty hiring, support for the Trotter Multicultural Center, and resistance to budget cuts affecting minority programs. BAM III also addressed the psychological climate for students of color and set the stage for subsequent diversity and equity initiatives.

## Significance
The BAM movements collectively transformed the University of Michigan and became national models for Black student organizing. They led to tangible policy outcomes such as the founding and expansion of the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS), the creation of support services like the [[Trotter Multicultural Center]], and the formalization of diversity offices and strategic enrollment goals.

More broadly, BAM showed the power of intersectional, multi-racial coalitions and long-term resistance within predominantly white institutions. The protests, writings, and legacy of BAM remain essential to understanding the history of higher education reform, affirmative action, and the lived experiences of Black students in the U.S.
